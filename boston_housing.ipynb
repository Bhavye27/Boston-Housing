In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

To maintain a proper balance between both of them and for a good fit, the data is splitted into training and testing subsets in a balanced ratio.\n",

If our model is underfitting we will know that from our train scores (which will be low). But if our model is overfitting, our train scores will be high. By first look it would seem we have done a great job in training, but most probably we have not. It is only after we test our model with the test set that we will know the real performance of our model. Using part of train set to test will always give good results if we are getting good train score (since our model is biased towards that data)\n",

    "Here, in this case, I am choosing the graph with max depth = 3. As we can see from the graph, the training and testing curves converge when score is near to 0.8 . In the graph with max_depth = 1, both the curves converge but the score is 0.4 . Score 1 is the best fit, so a model which has a greater score would be a best fit.\n",

    "The following code cell produces a graph for a decision tree model that has been trained and validated on the training data using different maximum depths. The graph produces two complexity curves — one for training and one for validation. Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.  \n",

    "### Question 5 - Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n",
    "* When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? \n",
    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

    "**Answer:** When the maximum depth is 1, the training and testing scores are very low which means that it is suffering from high bias and would not be able to perform well either on training or testing dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we train the model with maximum depth equal to 10, then we can see from the graph that the traing score is good but the testing score starts to decrease.Now this is the case of high variance. The model is good for the training dataset but would start giving errors on testing dataset."

    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",

    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",

    "- Create a dictionary for `'max_depth'` with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the `'params'` variable.\n",
